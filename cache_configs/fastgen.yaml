cache_strategy: ["hybrid"]
max_cache_length: [1.0]  # [Do not Change] Control compression ratio with min_recovery_frac
global_tokens: 4
# min_recovery_frac: 0.85  # Higher is less compression (0.85 means we choose the policy which compresses the most tokens AND recovers 85% of the full attention matrix)
